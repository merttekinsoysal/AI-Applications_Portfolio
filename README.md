Improved Risk Management: AI tools analyze large datasets to assess credit risk, detect potential threats, and ensure regulatory compliance.
Cost Savings and Productivity: AI's ability to process data at scale reduces operational costs while improving accuracy in tasks like financial forecasting and market analysis.
# Applications in Finance:
